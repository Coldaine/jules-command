Repo: Coldaine/jules-command

You are a coding agent with repo read/write + shell + PR capability.

Mission:
1) Determine what "jules-command" does (CLI? service? integration?) from docs and entrypoints.
2) Produce a concrete roadmap aligned to the project goal.
3) Execute Milestone 1 immediately.

Required reading:
- README.md + docs
- package.json / runtime entrypoints
- Any CLI/help output or command registry
- Open issues/PRs

Deliverables:
A) Contract summary:
   - Primary commands, inputs/outputs, auth model, and safety constraints

B) Execution plan:
   - Milestone 1: ensure install/run/build is clean; docs match reality; add tests for critical paths
   - Milestone 2+: feature roadmap

C) Execute Milestone 1:
   - Fix broken build/test/docs drift
   - Add a minimal integration or smoke test
   - Open PR with clear reproduction steps

Constraints:
- No secret leakage; redact tokens and document env usage.
- Keep PR scope tight.

Stopping condition:
- One PR open that improves reliability (build/test/docs) with a runnable example.
